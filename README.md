# CPP-STL-Container-Implementation
Some of the containers from STL(Standard Template Library) are implemented generically using C++

In C++ Standard Template Library is provided in which several Data structures and Algorithms are provied which we can use in our C++ code
simply by including particular header files.

In this project we are trying to implement few of those containers generically, and build header files which we can use in our c++ programs.

Till now we have implemented:

1. Vector
2. Priority Queue
3. Unordered Map
4. Set
5. Linked List
6. Stack
7. Queue

We are using C++ OOP concept and using templates for make the containers working for every data type.
We are working on the used algorithms and trying to make them more efficient.
